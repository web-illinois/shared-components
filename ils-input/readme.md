## State

Development on 1/23/2023

## Dependencies and Examples

Requires Illinois Toolkit, version 2.x. Everything else is vanilla javascript/CSS.

Note that adding this will reformat your input HTML tags automatically if they are in an il-formatted parent tag.

[Example of use](https://contrib.webtheme.illinois.edu/ils-input/index.html)

Required code to use

    <script src="//contrib.webtheme.illinois.edu/ils-input/input.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//contrib.webtheme.illinois.edu/ils-input/input.min.css" media="all">
    
### Version 3

I added a version 3 update. This requires all form information be inside an `<ilw-content>` tag.

This will need to be reconciled with the [Application Development Standards group](https://appdev.illinois.edu/), but that's a later problem. The JavaScript is mainly a helper application to manage `aria-required` and the toggle buttons. If you are using an alternate codebase like Blazor, the JavaScript file can be skipped.
